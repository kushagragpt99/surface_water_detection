# surface_water_detection

High-resolution measurements of geometry and dynamics of surface water are essential parameters required for many environmental applications, such as flood forecasting and warning, agricultural and urban water management, and simulation of transport of pollutants in water bodies. In this approach,the NIR band is a suitable choice for thresholding the image because water is highly absorptive in the NIR range, and land (especially vegetation) is highly reflective of NIR.
